# -Linear-Regression--Prediction-of-weight
Linear Regression uses mathematical equation to describe relationships. Here we are predicting the weight of a person using the height and also we are considering the Gender of that person. In this dataset our features are Gender and Weight and according to it we are predicting the weight. We are using simple equation Y = mx + c, where 'c' is the Y-intercept and 'm' is the slope of the line. We could use the equation to predict weight if we knew an individual's height. I have uploaded the ipynb colab notebook file and dataset that i have found on kaggle. To run this notebook, download it and just change the path of the dataset as in your pc.
